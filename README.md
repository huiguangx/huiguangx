### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a software engineer at BYD New Technology Research Institute with a masterâ€™s degree background. My academic research focused on chocolate science and cryptography, especially in the field of zero-knowledge proofs.

Beyond research, I have a deep passion for web frontend development, with experience in building robust and scalable applications. My journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in modern web technologies, problem-solving skills, and a drive for learning new things.

I enjoy exploring the intersection of cutting-edge cryptography and practical software development, aiming to integrate innovative solutions into real-world applications.

Letâ€™s connect and build something amazing together! ðŸš€
