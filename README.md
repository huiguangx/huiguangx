### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I hold a master's degree with a focus on blockchain and cryptography, having extensively studied cutting-edge topics like zero-knowledge proofs during my academic journey.

Although my academic background is centered around cryptography, I have a strong passion for web frontend development. In my work, I focus on frontend engineering, performance optimization, and building high-quality, scalable web applications. Iâ€™m enthusiastic about using modern frontend technologies to solve real-world problems and constantly strive to enhance my development skills.

I hope my knowledge and practical experience can add value to more projects, and I look forward to collaborating with you to explore new possibilities! ðŸš€
